## CODE_OF_CONDUCT

This is my first open project so I'm hoping engagement with the project will be positive, both for myself and all contributors.
As such I hope it becomes **harassment-free learning experience for everyone**.
All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. 

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other contributors.

Behave professionally. 


Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly project for all.
