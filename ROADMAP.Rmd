# Roadmap 

<br>

## First phase

### Crowdsourcing and planning

#### Functionality Review

I am interested in making the package work for as wide a demographic as possible which may therefore require expanding functionality. So I would at a first stage crowdsource ideas and develop a final plan on package development.

#### Code Review

Most of the functionality of the proposed package has already been developed and there is a repository of my **`r`** code that could be scavenged as a starting point. I envisage a code review element to the initial stage and welcome feedback on how the code could be improved.

### current issues:

**Long term:**

- **data structure** currently in lists. Could be a more integrated database object
- **automated taxonomic matching - taxonomic tracking**
- **network of citations** to track duplication though reuse of data
