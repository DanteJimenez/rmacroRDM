# Roadmap 

## First phase



### Crowdsourcing and planning

#### Workflow Review

I am interested in making the package work for as wide a demographic as possible which may therefore require expanding functionality. So I would at a first stage crowdsource ideas and develop a final plan on package development.

#### Code Review


Most of the functionality of the proposed package has already been developed and there is a repository of my **`r`** code that could be scavenged as a starting point. I envisage a code review element to the initial stage and welcome feedback on how the code could be improved.
