# Roadmap 

<br>

## **First phase**

### Crowdsourcing and planning

#### functionality review / user assessment [**ISSUE**](https://github.com/annakrystalli/rmacroRDM/issues/2)

I am interested in making the package work for as wide a demographic as possible which may therefore require expanding functionality. So I would at a first stage crowdsource ideas and develop a final plan on package development.

#### code review [**ISSUE**](https://github.com/annakrystalli/rmacroRDM/issues/3)

Most of the functionality of the proposed package has already been developed and there is a repository of **`r`** code as a starting point. I envisage a code review element to the initial stage and welcome feedback on how the code could be improved.

#### data format [**ISSUE**](https://github.com/annakrystalli/rmacroRDM/issues/6)

Currently the frameworks stores information in lists and dataframes. Could this be updated to better formats. eg [`data.table`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-faq.pdf) or some sort of r database object?

#### standardising data specification [**ISSUE**](https://github.com/annakrystalli/rmacroRDM/issues/7)

consensus on a basic level of standardised data specification standards for the data products of the package would greatly enhance downstream usability and longevity of data. So this could be a good space to begin to discuss and synthesise what would a model trait metadata structure look like. How can we build both interoperability and flexibility in data management and specification.

## Global Sprint

### Join me on **June 2-3** at the **Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint!**

I'll be available online to answer questions and discuss suggestions about all aspects of the project throughout the sprint.
